          You and your stack are now immersed in a game of Mario Party. You must
          traverse the game board (encompassing all of campus), participating in
          mini-games and missions at every turn. You cannot advance to your next
          turn until you successfully complete the current mini-game/mission.
          Stars and coins will be awarded based on your performance in these.
          Coins can be used to buy items/perks in future games. Whoever has the
          most stars at the end wins!

              The team with the most stars at the end wins! Stars are awarded at
              the end of each mini-game / puzzle mission. For games involving
              competition between multiple teams, more stars will be awarded to
              the winners. There may also be some bonus stars at the end for
              hidden missions <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>

              Coins are also rewarded at the end of mini-games and puzzles, the
              amount varying based on your performance in the event. Any coins
              you earn can be used in future activities to purchase perks. These
              perks may include items to help you out in a mini-game, hints for
              certain puzzles, etc.
