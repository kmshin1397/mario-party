# MarioParty

This project is a mobile-browser application parodying the Mario Party series for Caltech's Ditch Day 2019.

It is an Angular 7 application using a Firebase stack.

A demo is available at https://mario-party-a4e41.web.app/. To demo the app, you can log in as the "Kamek" user with the password "kamekpigeon".

It is recommended that the app be viewed either on a mobile-device, or similarly-sized screen, as the views are all designed for small screens and have not been made responsive to bigger windows.
